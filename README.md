# :potted_plant:	Hello friends, 

<br><img src="https://static.fandomspot.com/images/08/2191/16-moogle-woff-mirage.jpg" alt="moogle" width="200" align = "right"/>
Thank you for landing on my markdown document. If you're taking the time to learn more about me, I am grateful.  
My journey is a wild one. I am a product of two immigrants essentially floating on a jellyfish to get to America. My studies led me to an Economics degree, a billion less hours of sleep than a normal person, and a penchant for changing up my MySpace and Tumblr profiles.<br>Quickly after graduating, I became a technical recruiter and learned the world of programmers and developers.<br>By no real mapped-out plan, I ended up being Outcomes Coordinator teaching budding software engineers industry and market knowledge, resume building, and generally how to navigate the tech space on their own.
<br>I am in the middle of my diabolical plan to learn how to code like the next Ada Lovelace and take their job. (Just kidding for legal reasons.)
<br> That's the abridged story of how I got to the beginning of my coding journey.

Please feel more than free to look at my files. A lot are a work in progress or me just messing around with learning materials.

My portfolio should populate this space soon. Keep a lookout for that.
